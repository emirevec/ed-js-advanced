## Introduction

This repository serves as the home for the Integrative Project of the Advanced JavaScript and PWA JavaScript courses. It's designed to demonstrate the practical application of the concepts and skills learned throughout the courses.

## Project Description

The creation of a dynamic JavaScript ecommerce app with PWA features, including service worker and push notifications for seamless user experience.

## Workflow

We follow a development workflow inspired by GitFlow, which provides a structured approach to branch management. While we use GitFlow as a guideline, we also maintain the flexibility to adapt the workflow as needed to fit the requirements of our project.

## Javascript Libraries Used

This project leverages the following JavaScript libraries to enhance its functionality:

- jQuery is employed in this project to streamline client-side scripting and enhance the user interface.
- Handlebars is utilized in this project to efficiently manage and generate HTML content dynamically.

## Tailwind CSS for Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling, enabling a utility-first approach to building user interfaces. Tailwind provides a comprehensive set of utility classes, making styling more intuitive and efficient while maintaining flexibility in design.
